# Contributing to the Spring Camel JMS to DB Demo
First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Submit a Pull Request
1) Should you create an issue first? No, just create the pull request and use the description to provide context 
and motivation, as you would for an issue. If you want to start a discussion first or have already created an issue, 
once a pull request is created, we will close the issue as superseded by the pull request, and the discussion about 
the issue will continue under the pull request.
2) Choose the granularity of your commits consciously and squash commits that represent multiple edits or corrections 
of the same logical change. See [Rewriting History section of Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) 
for an overview of streamlining the commit history.

## Source Code Style
The wiki pages [Code Style](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Code-Style) 
and [IntelliJ IDEA Editor Settings](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/IntelliJ-IDEA-Editor-Settings) 
define the source file coding standards we use along with some IDEA editor settings we customize.
